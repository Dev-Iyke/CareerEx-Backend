      Hi! I am Obasi Ikechukwu Thompson. I am a frontend developer and an avid
      learner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In class this week, i learnt about the importance of the backend of a
      software, essentially stating its the brain of the software. In class we
      also learnt HTML as a building block to learning how both the web works
      and how the backend can interact with the frontend.
